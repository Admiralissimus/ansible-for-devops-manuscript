# Notes

## TODO SOON:

  - Add more info to 'Roles' section:
    - Where should I put variables? (See email to Najitaka dated 10/1/14).

    - `requirements.yml` in 1.8 (see: https://speakerdeck.com/mpdehaan/1-dot-8)
  - Clean up and fix the "Organizing more complex and cross-platform roles" in Chapter 6!
  - "Running first Ad-Hoc command" - Add an `I>` or tip or something about "passwordless SSH 101"

TODO (Add any of this?):

  - [Windows Support](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_windows.html)
  - Ansible configuration (`/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`)
  - Ansible Vault
  - High Performance / Scalable Ansible: Asynchronous actions, Polling, distributed Ansible, Redis-based fact cache

## Things to add

  - Patch management with Ansible (like Pulp? See how Puppet does it?).
  - Sudo auth via SSH keys (http://blather.michaelwlucas.com/archives/1106)
  - Jenkins - test playbook then run it

## Todo before final publication:

  - Delete (or rewrite?) section in beginning of book about how you can improve this book during writing.
  - Add illustrations all over the place!
  - Search for "that" in text.
  - Search for `...` in code examples and make it consistent.
  - Ensure cowsay is in every chapter summary.
  - Look through all code samples and fix line-wrapped lines.
  - Search for "—" (em-dash) in entire book and replace with `---`.
  - Search for "its" and "it's" and ensure proper grammatical usage.
  - Remove parentheses that are meaningless.
  - Search for 'ansible' (lower) and make sure non-CLI usage is capitalized.
  - Make sure credits are added:
    - Margie Newman - editor

## Thoughts on writing

  - [Zero to 95,688: How I wrote Game Programming Patterns](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/04/22/zero-to-95688-how-i-wrote-game-programming-patterns/)

## Cowsay

  - "Never ascribe to malice that which can adequately be explained by incompetence. (Napoleon Bonaparte)"
  - "Do or do not. There is no try. (Yoda)" (Used in 0.38 email 4/11/14)
  - "Never try to teach a pig to sing. It wastes your time and annoys the pig. (Proverb)."
  - "One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men. No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man. (Elbert Hubbard)"

## Publisher Offers

### O'Reilly

  - August 13, 2014
  - Met Greg D. at velocityconf, want to do some Ansible content
  - O'Reilly CTO was reading book, really liked it
  - Lots of early-release stuff (like Manning, other publishers), starting on 2nd chapter
  - Things they do:
    - Video products (sell standalone tutorials, get video content for config management tools, other devops tools...)
      - Filmed in studio, 3+ hour videos, available on Safari (owned by O'Reilly)
    - Content on Radar blog (authors write post on blog sometimes, write about other things, video podcast stuff)
    - Conferences (often speakers are authors/video people)
    - Interactive content
      - Create a useful learning environment (better than just a 'codeschool python thing')
      - Bring over some tutorials in book to docker so people can follow examples more closely
  - Learning Chef: Written from a dev background, reviewed by ops people
    - Ops guys wanted "show us how to do it", less the theory/principles
  - If interested in video, I could do a webcast as kind of a trial of how I work on video/audience...
  - **TODO**:
    - Provide a few examples of video tutorials and send them to Brian
    - Fill out proposal for book and send to Brian

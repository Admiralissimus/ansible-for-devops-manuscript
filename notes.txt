## Editing notes:

  - Spellcheck.
  - Search for "that" in text.
  - Search for `...` in code examples and make it consistent.
  - Ensure cowsay is in every chapter summary.
  - Look through all code samples and fix line-wrapped lines.
  - Search for "â€”" (em-dash) in entire book and replace with `---`.
  - Search for "its" and "it's" and ensure proper grammatical usage.
  - Remove parentheses that are meaningless.
  - Search for 'ansible' (lower) and make sure non-CLI usage is capitalized.
  - Search for 'simple' and 'simply', since I overuse these words.
  - Search for ' can' to find uses where it's removal makes sentences stronger.
  - Search for proper names (companies, software, etc.) and make sure they're capitalized.

## Publisher Offers

### O'Reilly

  - August 13, 2014
  - Met Greg D. at velocityconf, want to do some Ansible content
  - O'Reilly CTO was reading book, really liked it
  - Lots of early-release stuff (like Manning, other publishers), starting on 2nd chapter
  - Things they do:
    - Video products (sell standalone tutorials, get video content for config management tools, other devops tools...)
      - Filmed in studio, 3+ hour videos, available on Safari (owned by O'Reilly)
    - Content on Radar blog (authors write post on blog sometimes, write about other things, video podcast stuff)
    - Conferences (often speakers are authors/video people)
    - Interactive content
      - Create a useful learning environment (better than just a 'codeschool python thing')
      - Bring over some tutorials in book to docker so people can follow examples more closely
  - Learning Chef: Written from a dev background, reviewed by ops people
    - Ops guys wanted "show us how to do it", less the theory/principles
  - If interested in video, I could do a webcast as kind of a trial of how I work on video/audience...

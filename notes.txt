# Notes

## General TODO

  - Import people from LeanPub mailing list into MailChimp Mailing List.
  - Create favicon.ico for website.

## Editing notes:

  - Spellcheck.
  - Search for "that" in text.
  - Search for `...` in code examples and make it consistent.
  - Ensure cowsay is in every chapter summary.
  - Look through all code samples and fix line-wrapped lines.
  - Search for "â€”" (em-dash) in entire book and replace with `---`.
  - Search for "its" and "it's" and ensure proper grammatical usage.
  - Remove parentheses that are meaningless.
  - Search for 'ansible' (lower) and make sure non-CLI usage is capitalized.
  - Search for 'simple' and 'simply', since I overuse these words.
  - Search for ' can' to find uses where it's removal makes sentences stronger.
  - Search for proper names (companies, software, etc.) and make sure they're capitalized.
  - Search for ' a the' and fix those instances.
  - Search for "PLAY RECAP" and make sure code blocks are 74 lines (70 max without indent).

## Cowsay

  - "Never ascribe to malice that which can adequately be explained by incompetence. (Napoleon Bonaparte)"

## Improvements/new chapter ideas

  - VPN/Bastion/Jump host usage with Ansible (SSH)
  - High Performance / Scalable Ansible:
    - Profiling roles / tasks with callback plugins (see Sam Doran's blog post)
    - https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/slow-ansible-playbook-check-ansiblecfg
    - `synchronize` vs `copy`
  - Testing with [Molecule](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops/issues/101)
  - `reboot` module
  - Ansible AWX:
    - Difference between tower and AWX
    - Getting started with AWX vs Tower?
  - 2.0: Playbook Execution Strategies (`linear`, `free`, etc.).
  - Networking (routers? other stuff?)
  - Windows and Ansible (maybe?)
  - Security and Secret management
    - SSH private key management and security (see emails to/from Erik-jan Reimers)
    - Sudo auth via SSH keys (http://blather.michaelwlucas.com/archives/1106)
  - Playbooks, Roles, and Variables - organization for large teams and large projects
    - Specifically asked about this by Guy Matz (Guy.Matz.CFT@jcrew.com)

## Publisher Offers

### O'Reilly

  - August 13, 2014
  - Met Greg D. at velocityconf, want to do some Ansible content
  - O'Reilly CTO was reading book, really liked it
  - Lots of early-release stuff (like Manning, other publishers), starting on 2nd chapter
  - Things they do:
    - Video products (sell standalone tutorials, get video content for config management tools, other devops tools...)
      - Filmed in studio, 3+ hour videos, available on Safari (owned by O'Reilly)
    - Content on Radar blog (authors write post on blog sometimes, write about other things, video podcast stuff)
    - Conferences (often speakers are authors/video people)
    - Interactive content
      - Create a useful learning environment (better than just a 'codeschool python thing')
      - Bring over some tutorials in book to docker so people can follow examples more closely
  - Learning Chef: Written from a dev background, reviewed by ops people
    - Ops guys wanted "show us how to do it", less the theory/principles
  - If interested in video, I could do a webcast as kind of a trial of how I work on video/audience...

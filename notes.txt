# Notes

## TODO

  - Vagrant 1.8.0 ansible_local - replace all stuff about JJG-Ansible-Windows
  - Ansible 2.0:
    - Ansible `package` module for cross-platform use: https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Ansible_-_Only_if_on_specific_distribution_or_distribution_version.html
  - Use `become` instead of `sudo`: https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops/issues/22
  - [Galaxy 2.0](http://www.ansible.com/blog/galaxy-2.0-beta): Investigate what, if anything, should be updated.
  - Travis CI testing: Docker-based tests - see if I can reformat that chapter some.
    - https://bertvv.github.io/notes-to-self/2015/12/13/testing-ansible-roles-with-travis-ci-part-2-multi-platform-tests/
    - See also, Bert Van Vreckem's email from 12/16/15

## General TODO

  - Import people from LeanPub mailing list into MailChimp Mailing List.
  - Fix iBooks - add screenshots of some of the pages to the released book (so they're on the iBooks Store!)

## Editing notes:

  - Spellcheck.
  - Search for "that" in text.
  - Search for `...` in code examples and make it consistent.
  - Ensure cowsay is in every chapter summary.
  - Look through all code samples and fix line-wrapped lines.
  - Search for "—" (em-dash) in entire book and replace with `---`.
  - Search for "its" and "it's" and ensure proper grammatical usage.
  - Remove parentheses that are meaningless.
  - Search for 'ansible' (lower) and make sure non-CLI usage is capitalized.
  - Search for 'simple' and 'simply', since I overuse these words.
  - Search for ' can' to find uses where it's removal makes sentences stronger.
  - Search for proper names (companies, software, etc.) and make sure they're capitalized.
  - Search for ' a the' and fix those instances.
  - Search for "PLAY RECAP" and make sure code blocks are 74 lines (70 max without indent).

## Pre-publication

  - Make sure Changelog is removed.

## Publishing Process

### iBooks (Apple)

  - Had to sign up for a _new_ Apple ID (my existing ID is used for iOS and Mac app distribution).
  - Had to verify my email address and re-enter _everything_ for tax ID, banking, etc.
  - Angular-based dashboard on iTunes connect was less-than-stellar on Chrome (worked better in Safari).
  - Had to download iTunes Producer to add book (it was not obvious in the UI—I just saw the message "You don’t have any books." when I visited the 'My Books' section of iTunes Connect).

## Thoughts on writing

## Publisher Offers

### O'Reilly

  - August 13, 2014
  - Met Greg D. at velocityconf, want to do some Ansible content
  - O'Reilly CTO was reading book, really liked it
  - Lots of early-release stuff (like Manning, other publishers), starting on 2nd chapter
  - Things they do:
    - Video products (sell standalone tutorials, get video content for config management tools, other devops tools...)
      - Filmed in studio, 3+ hour videos, available on Safari (owned by O'Reilly)
    - Content on Radar blog (authors write post on blog sometimes, write about other things, video podcast stuff)
    - Conferences (often speakers are authors/video people)
    - Interactive content
      - Create a useful learning environment (better than just a 'codeschool python thing')
      - Bring over some tutorials in book to docker so people can follow examples more closely
  - Learning Chef: Written from a dev background, reviewed by ops people
    - Ops guys wanted "show us how to do it", less the theory/principles
  - If interested in video, I could do a webcast as kind of a trial of how I work on video/audience...

## O'Reilly Book Offer

  - Met Greg D. at velocityconf, want to do some Ansible content
  - O'Reilly CTO was reading book, really liked it
  - Lots of early-release stuff (like Manning, other publishers), starting on 2nd chapter
  - Things they do:
    - Video products (sell standalone tutorials, get video content for config management tools, other devops tools...)
      - Filmed in studio, 3+ hour videos, available on Safari (owned by O'Reilly)
    - Content on Radar blog (authors write post on blog sometimes, write about other things, video podcast stuff)
    - Conferences (often speakers are authors/video people)
    - Interactive content
      - Create a useful learning environment (better than just a 'codeschool python thing')
      - Bring over some tutorials in book to docker so people can follow examples more closely
  - Learning Chef: Written from a dev background, reviewed by ops people
    - Ops guys wanted "show us how to do it", less the theory/principles
  - If interested in video, I could do a webcast as kind of a trial of how I work on video/audience...
  - **TODO**:
    - Provide a few examples of video tutorials and send them to Brian
    - Fill out proposal for book and send to Brian

## Things to add

  - Patch management with Ansible (like Pulp? See how Puppet does it?).
  - Sudo auth via SSH keys (http://blather.michaelwlucas.com/archives/1106)
  - Scaling Ansible to large # of nodes (100+? Using pull mode? Using local connection and git repo? Using push?)
  - Jenkins - test playbook then run it

## Todo before final publication:

  - Delete (or rewrite?) section in beginning of book about how you can improve this book during writing.
  - Add illustrations all over the place!
  - Search for "that" in text.
  - Search for `...` in code examples and make it consistent.
  - Ensure cowsay is in every chapter summary.
  - Look through all code samples and fix line-wrapped lines.
  - Search for "—" (em-dash) in entire book and replace with `---`.
  - Search for "its" and "it's" and ensure proper grammatical usage.
